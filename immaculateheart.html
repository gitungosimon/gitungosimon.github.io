	<h4>Act of Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h4>
	<p>Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our Mother, to your Immaculate Heart we consecrate ourselves, in an act of total entrustment to the Lord.
By You we will be led to Christ. By Him and with Him we will be led to the Father.
We will walk in the light of faith, and we will do everything so that the world may believe that Jesus Christ is the One sent by the Father.
With Him we wish to carry His Love and Salvation to the ends of the earth.
Under the protection of your Immaculate Heart, we will be one People with Christ. We will be witnesses of His Resurrection. By Him we will be led to the Father, for the glory of the Most Holy Trinity, Whom we adore, praise and bless forever. Amen.</p>
<h4>The devotion of the Five First Saturdays</h4>
<p>On October 1925 Lucy dos Santos joined as a postulant in the Dorothean house at Pontevedra, Spain. Here on December 10, 1925, sister Lucy received an apparition by the Child Jesus and the Virgin Mary in her convent cell. The Holy Virgin shown her a Heart surrounded by thorns, Our Lady said to her:

"See, My daughter, My heart surrounded by thorns which ungrateful men pierce at every moment by their blasphemies and ingratitude... Say to all those who: 
<ul>
	<li>for five months, on the first Saturday, confess, </li>
	<li>receive Holy Communion, </li>
	<li>recite the Rosary </li>
	<li>and keep Me company for 15 minutes while meditating on the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary, in a spirit of reparation, </li>
</ul>
I promise to assist them at the hour of death with all the graces necesary for the salvation of their souls."

The confession can be made a few days earlier, and if in this previous confession you have forgotten the (required) intention the following intention can be offered, provided that on the first Saturday one receives Holy Communion in a state of grace, with the intention of repairing for offenses against the Most Holy Virgin and which afflict Her Immaculate Heart.

Five first Saturdays of reparation were requested to atone for the five ways in which people offend the Immaculate Heart of Mary:</p>
<ol>
	<li>attacks upon Mary's Immaculate Conception.</li>
	<li>attacks against her Perpetual Virginity.</li>
	<li>attacks upon her Divine Maternity and the refusal to accept her as the Mother of all mankind.</li>
	<li>for those who try to publicly implant in children's hearts indifference, contempt and even hatred of this Immaculate Mother.</li>
	<li>for those who insult her directly in her sacred images.</li>
</ol>
<p>The greatest joy is to see the Immaculate Heart of our so tender Mother known, loved and consoled by the means of this devotion." <span>Sister Lucia</span>
